\section{Introduction}

Early research in activity detection aimed at finding differences in signal characteristics of the collected accelerometer data, and determining the ideal sensor placement. 
In \cite{2011_Sensor_Positioning}, activities were grouped together into four categories by levels of physical activity, and sensors were placed throughout the body to determine the best location for each of the categories.
Their results found each category performed best with a different sensor location. A sensor placed on the waist was best at detecting low level activities like eating, while a sensor on the chest or wrist was best at medium level activities like housework.




Though they also found that an accelerometer was not enough to classify activities.


Accelerometer data was not enough ( \cite{2011_Sensor_Positioning} )

Not ideal since causes great inconvinience to people (elderly paper)

To address the inconvenience of full body sensors and the need for context, \cite{2012_WristSense} used a wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and camera to collect recognize daily activities.
The camera provided context for the activities, and the accelerometer provided characteristics of the body movement associated with different activities, both of which were used to train a model to predict the activity. 


Now smartwatches have become a popular commodity, so more easily accessible with lots of data to collect but without being a burden on the user.
